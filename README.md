Group pay is a transaction tracking webservice. Users are able to signup and then add other users groups. Users are able to link transactions to groups. When adding a transaction to a group the user will need to manually add how much money each group member owes. Group members will then recieve this new transaction and will be able to set it as paid when the member pays their portion. After, the users portion of the transaction will be set paid.
